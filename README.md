Hidden tabbar
=============

When working on a project I was having a problem with the native tab bar controller in IOS. They have been around since the beginning of the platform and are a great way to easily navigate without actually leaving the current view, which is awesome.

But I had some issues:

* It takes up a lot of valueable screen space
* Distracts the user from the actual content
* A user could accidentally switch views

It kept me thinking, why do designers just accept the way that native components work and take it for granted. I admit they're already great straight out of the box and making them better would probably be really hard to do. But we can make an attempt to make them relevant to the project we're working on. In my case I tried to make the tab bar as unobtrusive as possible and still keep it easy to use.

## The prototype
Check out the working [prototype](http://immense-depths-1821.herokuapp.com). It works in chrome but it's intended to be added as a web app to your homescreen. I'ts only been tested on an iPhone 5 with IOS 7, so sorry if it might not work on any other devices.
